                   transformation will be in skolem normal form.

                  quantifiers, labels, or is in the scope of a
                  quantifier. The result of the transformation will be
                  in skolem normal form, and the body of quantifiers
                  will be in NNF. If a ground formula is too expensive to
                  be put into NNF, then nested quantifiers and labels 
                  are renamed.

                  This mode is sufficient when using Superposition
                  Calculus.

                  Remark: If the problem does not contain quantifiers,
                  then NNF_QUANT is identical to NNF_SKOLEM.
