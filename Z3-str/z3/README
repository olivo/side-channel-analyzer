Z3 is a theorem prover from Microsoft Research.
Z3 is licensed under MSR-LA (Microsoft Research License Agreement). 
See http://z3.codeplex.com/license for more information about this license.
Z3 can be built using Visual Studio Command Prompt, Visual Studio and make/gcc.

1) Building Z3 on Windows using Visual Studio Command Prompt

- Open a Visual Studio Command Prompt, then execute one of the following commands to build the desired component.

- For building all components, execute
    msbuild z3-prover.sln /p:configuration=external 
  All components will be located at /external

- For building all components (64-bit), execute
    msbuild z3-prover.sln /p:configuration=external_64 /p:platform=x64
  All components will be located at /external_64

- For building all components (in debug mode), execute
    msbuild z3-prover.sln 
  All components will be located at /debug

1) Building Z3 using g++/make
Your machine must also have the following commands to be able to build Z3:
autoconf, sed, awk, dos2unix commands


- Open a shell
- For building the z3 executable, execute
 
  autoconf
  ./configure
  make

The z3 executable will be located at bin/external/

- If you want a static library for Z3

  make a

- If you also want the z3 shared library, execute

  make so

  for libz3.so (on Linux)

  make dylib

  for libz3.dylib (on OSX)

Remark: the Z3 makefile imports the source file list from Visual Studio project files.
To add new source files to the Z3 core, you must include them at: lib/lib.vcxproj
